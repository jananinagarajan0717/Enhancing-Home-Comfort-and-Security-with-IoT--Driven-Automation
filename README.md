The aim of the project is to build a home automation system with the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The system will give users an accessible, flexible, and scalable way for controlling appliances in the home. Users can efficiently handle their home environment via a web interface or smartphone application to control the system remotely.

The ESP8266 microcontroller and two-channel relays are the essential components of the system that allow for the real-time monitoring and control of appliances, as well as security systems. To enhance user interaction, the system explores the integration of voice control and artificial intelligence. It minimizes basic household operations and enhances the home's functionality.


## Abstract :
Nowadays, smart home solutions are in high demand due to their ability to improve security, energy efficiency, and comfort. This project develops and implements an IoT-based home automation system to monitor and control household appliances. The system uses the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller, LDR, and DHT sensor. A relay turns lighting systems ON and OFF based on luminance, and an LDR detects ambient light. A DHT sensor can also improve domestic comfort by monitoring temperature and humidity. The NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller's Wi-Fi allows real-time remote monitoring and control of the system via a mobile app or web interface. This project aims to create a scalable, cost-effective, and easy-to-implement smart home solution that improves user convenience and energy efficiency. It also allows future expansions like adding sensors, connecting to cloud-based data recording services, or adding voice control.
