The aim of the project is to build a home automation system with the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The system will give users an accessible, flexible, and scalable way for controlling appliances in the home. Users can efficiently handle their home environment via a web interface or smartphone application to control the system remotely.

The ESP8266 microcontroller and two-channel relays are the essential components of the system that allow for the real-time monitoring and control of appliances, as well as security systems. To enhance user interaction, the system explores the integration of voice control and artificial intelligence. It minimizes basic household operations and enhances the home's functionality.
